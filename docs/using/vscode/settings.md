# VS Code Extension — Settings

Settings live in the Mitii sidebar webview. The left rail is **icons only** when the panel is narrow (≤440px). Hover or focus an icon to see its name in a tooltip. When the panel is wider, the rail shows **icons + labels**.

Click **Save** to persist. Edits stay local until Save, except API key prompts and profile switch, which talk to the host immediately.

VS Code configuration keys use the `mitii.*` prefix. Profiles are stored in `.mitii/profiles.json`. API keys stay in VS Code SecretStorage.

## Pages

| Page | Tab id | What it is for |
|---|---|---|
| Provider | `model` | Connect a model. Open this first. |
| Autocomplete | `autocomplete` | Configure FIM inline suggestions |
| Workspace | `workspace` | Folder + repository index |
| Modes | `modes` | Ask / Plan / Agent defaults and run budget |
| Context | `context` | What is attached to each turn |
| MCP | `integrations` | Optional MCP servers |
| Developer | `debug` | Logging, token-budget tunables, diagnostics |

The index status chip opens **Workspace**. Onboarding and "open settings" open **Provider**.

## Provider

Required setup. Connection and credentials are at the top so you do not scroll past the index to find them.

### Connection

| UI field | Setting | Save / reflect |
|---|---|---|
| Provider | `mitii.provider.preset` + `mitii.provider.type` | Saved preset prefills base URL and model. After Save, the same preset is shown. Includes **Ollama Cloud** (`https://ollama.com/v1`). |
| Base URL | `mitii.provider.baseUrl` | Saved as typed. Local hosts do not need a key. |
| Model | `mitii.provider.model` | Dropdown or Custom. Saved model id is reflected exactly. |

### Credentials

| UI field | Storage | Save / reflect |
|---|---|---|
| Set key / Clear | SecretStorage `mitii.provider.apiKey` | Never written to settings JSON. Status shows `configured` or `not set`. |
| Test connection | Host probe | Status pill + model list only. Does **not** persist settings or reset unsaved drafts. |

Anthropic and Gemini require a key. Echo and local OpenAI-compatible hosts usually do not.

### Web search (optional)

External / product / docs asks grant the `web_search` tool when at least one search provider is configured via `@mitii/search-kit` (wired through `@mitii/host`). Explicit phrases like "search the web for …" or "check vulnerabilities online …" also grant it (including security/dependency intents). Local-only security fixes (e.g. "fix XSS in this file") stay offline.

| UI field / env | Storage | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SearXNG base URL | `mitii.search.searxngBaseUrl` | Preferred free path (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8080`). Wins over env. **Save** settings after editing; pasting the URL in chat does not configure search. |
| Set web search key / Clear | SecretStorage `mitii.search.apiKey` | Optional Brave key. Command palette: **Mitii: Set Web Search API Key**. |
| `BRAVE_API_KEY` / `MITII_SEARCH_API_KEY` | Environment | Same Brave key if SecretStorage is empty. |
| `SEARXNG_BASE_URL` / `MITII_SEARXNG_URL` | Environment | Self-hosted SearXNG when the setting is empty. |
| `TAVILY_API_KEY` | Environment | Optional Tavily fallback. |
| `MITII_SEARCH_PROVIDERS` | Environment | Optional order, e.g. `searxng,brave,tavily`. |

Default order when unset: SearXNG (if URL) → Brave (if key) → Tavily (if key).

Use the **base URL only** (no `/search` path). The instance must allow JSON (`/search?format=json`). CLI config uses the same providers — see [CLI Setup](/using/CLI/setup#web-search-searxng).

`fetch_url` / `fetch_docs` use a content-aware `NetworkPort`: Stack Overflow answers, GitHub issue threads, Wikipedia, arXiv abstracts, then HTML readability. After `web_search`, result hosts are widened into the grant so the agent can fetch top hits.

Without any provider, Mitii completes the turn from model knowledge and logs that SearchPort is not configured.

### Token limits

The context window is the only token setting a customer needs. Retrieval, compaction, mutation batches, verification checks, and the derived model-call cap scale from that window. Developer → Token budget is optional.

**Source of truth:** a positive `mitii.provider.contextWindow` always wins for budgeting, compact/standard/wide bands, and loop-history compaction ceilings. `0` means auto (model preset → provider/model heuristic → 32 768 fallback).

| UI field | Setting | Save / reflect |
|---|---|---|
| Context window | `mitii.provider.contextWindow` | Type freely, then click **Save**. The field does not write on each keystroke. After Save, the raw number is what you see. `0` means "use the model preset". |
| Max output | `mitii.provider.maximumOutputTokens` | Same commit rules as context window. `0` derives the output reserve from the window (~20%, floored so a 30k local cap can still finish a mutation batch). Leave at `0` unless you need a hard override. A positive value is a host override for generation; the legacy default `5000` is ignored. |
| Derived budget | Live preview | Usable input, output reserve, model-call cap, files per mutation, verification checks, and a module-share bar. Updates as soon as the context window or max output changes. |
| Reset budgets to defaults | Clears `mitii.tokenBudget.*` | Turns off custom token-budget overrides and restores built-in ratios for the current window. |

Runtime still uses the **effective** window (`0` → model preset, else the stored number). The token meter uses that effective value, not `0`.

## Autocomplete

Optional editor inline suggestions. Autocomplete is separate from Ask/Plan/Agent so you can use a fast FIM model without changing the main agent provider.

Mitii registers a VS Code inline completion provider at startup, but it sends no network requests unless `mitii.autocomplete.enabled` is true. Requests are file-only, workspace-trust aware, bounded by prefix/suffix character limits, skipped for ignored/security-sensitive paths, debounced, and aborted on typing or timeout.

| UI field | Setting | Save / reflect |
|---|---|---|
| Enable autocomplete | `mitii.autocomplete.enabled` | Saved on Save or via **Mitii: Toggle Autocomplete**. |
| Provider | `mitii.autocomplete.provider` | Currently `openai-compatible`. |
| Base URL | `mitii.autocomplete.baseUrl` | Empty inherits `mitii.provider.baseUrl`. |
| Model | `mitii.autocomplete.model` | Empty inherits `mitii.provider.model`. |
| Endpoint path | `mitii.autocomplete.endpointPath` | Appended to the base URL. Common values are `completions` and `fim/completions`. |
| Auth header | `mitii.autocomplete.authHeader` | Uses SecretStorage `mitii.provider.apiKey` as `authorization`, `api-key`, or `x-api-key`. |
| Max tokens | `mitii.autocomplete.maxTokens` | Clamped to 1–512. |
| Debounce | `mitii.autocomplete.debounceMs` | Clamped to 0–2000ms. |
| Timeout | `mitii.autocomplete.timeoutMs` | Clamped to 250–30000ms. |
| Prefix chars | `mitii.autocomplete.prefixChars` | Clamped to 128–60000 characters before the cursor. |
| Suffix chars | `mitii.autocomplete.suffixChars` | Clamped to 0–60000 characters after the cursor. |
| Temperature | `mitii.autocomplete.temperature` | Clamped to 0–2. |

The HTTP body follows the generic OpenAI-style FIM shape:

```json
{
  "model": "your-fim-model",
  "prompt": "text before cursor",
  "suffix": "text after cursor",
  "max_tokens": 96,
  "temperature": 0.2,
  "stream": false
}
```

## Workspace

| UI field | Setting | Save / reflect |
|---|---|---|
| Folder path | Workspace folder | Read-only display of the active root. |
| Open folder | VS Code folder picker | Immediate. |
| Root path override | `mitii.workspace.rootPathOverride` | Saved on Save. Clear override writes empty/null and reflects no override. |
| Reindex / Refresh | Index pipeline | Immediate. Not a setting. |
| Index stats / capabilities | Index snapshot | Read-only diagnostics. |

## Modes

### Mode defaults (Ask / Plan / Agent)

Each mode has its own row. Switching the Ask / Plan / Agent control edits that mode only.

| UI field | Setting | Save / reflect |
|---|---|---|
| Approval mode | `mitii.ui.modeDefaults.<mode>.approvalMode` | `safe` (ask) / `guided` (approve for me) / `pilot` (full access). Composer changes also update the active mode default and `mitii.safety.approvalMode` immediately so Save cannot restore Agent's default `safe`. |
| Default model | `mitii.ui.modeDefaults.<mode>.model` | Empty = use the active Provider model. |
| Show reasoning stream | `mitii.ui.showReasoning` | Global, not per mode. |
| Reasoning preview chars | `mitii.ui.reasoningPreviewMaxChars` | 500–50000. Reflected as the saved integer. |

Thoroughness stays on the **composer** (not duplicated here). Ship loop / window defaults: `pnpm policy-admin`.

### Run budget

Caps for a single Mitii turn.

| UI field | Setting | Save / reflect |
|---|---|---|
| Unlimited run budget | `mitii.runBudget.unlimited` | When on, the four caps are ignored at runtime. |
| Model calls | `mitii.runBudget.maxModelCalls` | Minimum 1. |
| Tool calls | `mitii.runBudget.maxToolCalls` | Minimum 1. |
| Loop iterations | `mitii.runBudget.maxLoopIterations` | Minimum 1. |
| Wall time (min) | `mitii.runBudget.maxWallTimeMinutes` | Minimum 1. |

These caps are owned here. You do not need to retune them when the context window changes. Developer → Token budget does not override them.

### Log verbosity

Controls how much diagnostic detail lands in the run log (visible via "Export session log" / "Open session log").

| UI field | Setting | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Log verbosity | `mitii.logVerbosity` | `minimal` (baseline events only), `standard` (adds reason codes and before/after values for clamps and soft failures), `verbose` (default; adds retry/nudge-level detail). Turn this down if exported logs are too noisy — it does not change what the agent does, only what it records. |

## Context

| UI field | Setting | Save / reflect |
|---|---|---|
| Repo map | `mitii.ui.contextToggles.repoMap` | Boolean. Default off; auto-enabled for deep / CI-git impact asks. |
| Diagnostics | `mitii.ui.contextToggles.diagnostics` | Boolean. |
| Git diff | `mitii.ui.contextToggles.gitDiff` | Boolean. Default off; auto-enabled for deep / CI-git impact asks. |
| Active editor | `mitii.ui.contextToggles.editor` | Boolean. |
| Open tabs | `mitii.ui.contextToggles.openTabs` | Boolean. Default off. |
| Memory | `mitii.ui.contextToggles.memory` | Boolean. Default on. |
| Memory list | Workspace memory store | Add / delete / clear are immediate host calls. |
| Checkpoints | Checkpoint store | Restore / delete / clear are immediate host calls. |

## MCP

| UI field | Setting | Save / reflect |
|---|---|---|
| Enable MCP | `mitii.mcp.enabled` (and/or `.mitii/mcp.json`) | Master switch. Off by default. |
| Installed servers | `mitii.mcp.servers` | Enable, configure, or delete per server. Saved on Save. |
| Store catalog | Built-in catalog | Install copies a server into the workspace list. |

Runtime status (ready / error / disabled) is diagnostic only.

## Developer

Keep this minimal. Permanent ship policy lives in `pnpm policy-admin`.

### Access

| UI field | Setting | Save / reflect |
|---|---|---|
| Enable developer settings | `mitii.developer.enabled` | Unlocks Logging and local Custom token / loop editors. |

### Logging

| UI field | Setting | Save / reflect |
|---|---|---|
| Debug logging | `mitii.debug` | When on, Mitii shows the Output channel and prints verbose stacks. Locked until Access is enabled. |
| Log model I/O | `mitii.developer.modelIo` | When on (and Access enabled), writes sanitized model request/response bodies to `.mitii/logs/*-model-io.jsonl`. Large; may include workspace content — keep local. Command **Mitii: Export Shareable Diagnostic** builds one redacted markdown file under `.mitii/logs/` for pasting into online chat help. |

### Token budget (local)

Optional local overrides for this machine. Module shares are of usable input and **need not total 100%** — leftover shows as **Free** in the allocation bar.

| UI field | Setting | Save / reflect |
|---|---|---|
| Custom token budget | `mitii.tokenBudget.enabled` | Turns on when you move a Simple slider. When off, V8 defaults scale from the window. |
| Simple: files / output / shares / verification | `mitii.tokenBudget.*` | Local sliders only. Ship defaults: `pnpm policy-admin`. |
| Module split | Live preview | Stacked bar of output, tools, repository, conversation, plan, skills, and **Free**. |
| Reset budgets to defaults | Clears `mitii.tokenBudget.*` | Restores window-scaled defaults. |

### Loop / stall (local)

| UI field | Setting | Save / reflect |
|---|---|---|
| Active band (read-only) | Derived from provider context window | Compact / standard / wide. |
| Custom loop policy | `mitii.loopPolicy.enabled` | Local lab deltas on the active band. |
| Simple fields | `mitii.loopPolicy.*` | Shown only while Custom is on. |
| Reset to ship band | Clears `mitii.loopPolicy.*` | Restores shipped band for the current window. |

### Ship policy (HTML, not in VS Code)

```bash
pnpm policy-admin
```

Edits `loopPolicyBands.ts` + `windowBudgetBands.ts`. See `tools/policy-admin/README.md`.

### Diagnostics

Read-only: provider connection, MCP runtime, index token, index mode, preset label, active policy band. Use **View → Output → Mitii** for logs.

## Profiles and Save

The footer is always visible.

| Control | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Profile select | Switches `.mitii/profiles.json` immediately and reloads provider fields. |
| New | Creates a profile from the current provider snapshot. |
| Save | Writes provider, UI, MCP, workspace override, and the active profile. Then the host bootstraps the webview so every field **reflects the stored value**. |

### Reflection rules

1. **Raw fields** (almost everything) show exactly what was saved.
2. **Context window `0`** stays `0` in the field. Runtime and the hint use the effective preset window.
3. **Max output `0`** stays `0` in the field. Runtime derives the reserve.
4. **Secrets** never echo back as text — only configured / not set.
5. **Invalid numbers** clamp to the field minimum on Save (token limits cannot go below 0; run-budget caps cannot go below 1).
